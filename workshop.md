Goals can be: tangible (students will become familiar with fused filament fabrication), intangible (sstudents will be enthusiastic about Additive Manufacturing) or procedural (students will practice working collaboratively).

## To reach our goals we need material

## Our goals involve the activity of people

PEOPLE ----+----> Interactive
           |
